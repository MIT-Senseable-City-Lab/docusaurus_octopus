Welcome to the Octopus Platform Blog! This blog will be used as a forum to share stories, experiences and ideas by using the Octopus Platform, so others can find inspiration and share the engagement in developing environmental sensing projects. 

<!-- truncate -->

The Octopus Platform was developed by the MIT Senseable City Lab in 2024 as a platform for makers to engage and learn how to build environmental sensing projects by using low cost sensing technologies. The project was named Octopus as the design decisions were based on features from an octopus: changing colors, highly flexible different movement "strategies" (swimming, walking), they can "stick to anything", and are placed all around the world. **This is our goal of the Octopus Platform as well**. We want makers to build, share, and engage with a community of enthusiastic makers aiming at using technologies to better understand our environments, and through a variety of examples and fabrication methods, have fun while doing it!
