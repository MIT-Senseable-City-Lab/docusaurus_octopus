### Bodyframe components

Components you need to order to build the body frame:

| **Bodyframe** | **Type** | **Comment** | **URL** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Filament |  White PLA or PETG | For 3D printing the octopus, make sure the filament you order works with your printer! | [link](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/nl-nl/collections/pla/products/pla-basic-filament) |

**Note**: To attatch the bodyframe to other surfaces you need to buy other components. Possible attatchments can be anything with a basic gopro mount (like a tripod), rubberbands, magnets, or strings.
