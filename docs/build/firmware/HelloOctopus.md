# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Octopus!

_Upload your first sketch!_

---

This guide will show you how to upload your first octopus file and check that everything is set up correctly! 

**Upload the program**

*Assuming you have the file temp_octopus.ino*

Now, just click the "Upload" button in the environment, and allow a few seconds for the process - you should observe the orange LED on the board gradually pulsing in and out. Upon successful upload, you will see the message "Done uploading." displayed in the status bar.

_Please note: If the board fails to enter upload mode, perform a double press on the reset button before initiating the upload process. This action should prompt the orange LED to pulse, indicating that the board is ready for upload._

After a few seconds, you should see the LED on the octopus light up purple. If that is the case, good work! Everything is correctly set up! If not, try toubleshooting suggestions from the [arduino help center](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us).
