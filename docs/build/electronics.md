![OctopuPCB](../../static/img/electronics/OctopusPCB.png)
 
The costum PCB can be set up to ways: 
1. Order the board from a manufacturing company and ask them to pre-solder the components for you. 
2. Order the board and all small hardware components separately, and solder it by hand. *Note, this requires you to know how to solder small components.*
