## **Step 2**: How to make the "octopus legs"

[add guide from Chada + images]

1. Print the two parts of the mold using the files provided in the document 
2. Cut a piece of steel fencing wire of 15.5cm length
3. Place the wire on one side of the mold 
4. Position two neodymium magnets on the closed end, one on each side of the wire
5. Close the mold and place vertically on a flat surface. Use two small clamps to keep it properly sealed and prevent any silicone leakage during pouring 
6. Prepare the silicone mixture according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer
7. Optional: Use a degasser to remove any bubbles from the mixture
8. Using a small 20mL syringe, pour the silicone mixture slowly from the opening of the mold, ensuring the wire remains centered during the pouring process. *NB*: As the mixture reaches the top of the mold, it may take longer to fill it - giving the impression that the casting is complete. Keep on eye on it every ~5 min to ensure the silicone has indeed stopped flowing and doesnâ€™t go down the opening anymore.
9. Allow the silicone to cure completely according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions
10. Trim any excess silicone resulting from the pouring process


## **Step 3**: How to assemble everything together


*NB:* Before starting with this step, you need to have all [Hardware components] [INPUT LINK TO DOCUMENT] ready and placed inside the octopus head.
