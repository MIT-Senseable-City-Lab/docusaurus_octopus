# About Octopus

---
# *We empower communities around the world to map their environment*

The octopus is a personal environmental sensing device made for makers who are interested in developing and adapting low-cost environmental sensing projects. We are taking the next step with low-cost environmental sensing from a prototype to a personal device makers can develop and deploy over time to track changes in their environment. 

**The octopus** is a new iteration from the original [City Scanner](https://senseable.mit.edu/cityscanner/) project at [Senseable City Lab, MIT](https://senseable.mit.edu/), that aims to empower communities around the world to map their environment. 

## History of City Scanner

TODO: [insert picture of history of city scanner]

The first prototype of the mobile environmental sensor was called Greta (2017), and the next iterations (Greta 2, Blackburn, Whiteburn, and Flatburn) were all based on the same idea of making a mobile environmental sensing device to put on top of a viecle to collect hyperlocal environmental data. 


The latest iteration was [Flatburn (2023)](https://senseable.mit.edu/flatburn/). Part of the City Scanner project, Flatburn is an open-source, 3D-printed environmental sensor, powered using a solar panel and can be mounted on vehicles using magnetic pads. After the release of Flatburn, there has been a need from the open-source community to make something similar for makers in terms of cost, flexibility, modifiability, and use cases to deploy such a device. Because of this, researchers at Senseable City Lab decided to develop a personalized device, keeping the same success factors from Flatburn, and making environmental sensing projects even more available for makers.

### Choices in Fabrication

The Octopus has many choices in fabrication designed for makers to develop and deploy the device. They are all selected to keep the price low using accessible tools for the maker communities such as 3D printing and the reuse of Arduino components commonly used in projects today. To make the "legs" for the octopus, use ingredients from your kitchen to "cook" it together! 

- 3D printing

- "Make your octopus in your kitchen"

- Reuse of Arduino boards

### Modifiability

Modifiability is one key feature for the octopus, where the makers are able to modify their octopus related to what they want to sense! 

- Arduino boards - Nano and Nicla

- Selection of SPS30 Senserion (gas), GPS, temperaature, humidity, and barometic pressure.
